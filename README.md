# Development-of-a-Bat-Inspired-Mico-UAV
Designed an autonomous biologically inspired flying machine having bat morphology for disaster management 

Problem Statement: Design and develop a bat-inspired micro UAV that can assist in disaster management through rescue and surveillance operations

Approach:

Several mechanisms, including the watts six bar linkage and crank-shaft, have been installed which allows the machine to exhibit flapping, mediolateral and dorsoventral motions

The geometric and aerodynamic parameters, having similar values as for the biological bat, have been utilized in the design, which makes the machine highly efficient due to increase in lift and flight range

After performing a detailed kinematic analysis, a mathematical modelling, for the optimization of aerodynamic parameters of the micro-UAV, was developed on MATLAB in order to obtain the synchronicity between the forelimb mechanisms

Outcome:

Piezo-electric transducers were attached on the wing membrane, so once the robot starts flapping, a sinusoidal waveform is generated on the oscilloscope with a root mean square (rms) value of 60.0 mV that was amplified to 2V throguh a signal amplification circuit designed on MATLAB

A faster and robust PID controller was designed on SIMULINK to optimize the flapping frequency. For a step input, the response settled at 1.14 seconds, and the overshoot was 8.63%
